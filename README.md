# prediction_for_NYC_taxis
This project uses public data set from the NYC TLC website to look for the pick-up and drop off times, trip lengths, surcharges associated with the trip and the number of people taking the taxi through the day to suggest the best time to travel by taxi in NYC. This way, people can plan their trip ahead of time by checking our model which will have predictions of the best time for every day of the year.

### Folder Organization ###
 - images : contains images generated, or used by our code.
 - VizualisationNotebooks : contains all Jupyter Notebooks + the Final_notebook.ipynb which mirrors all the visualizations provided in the presentation
 - src : contains python source codes that we used to figure the dataset out and experiment on

### Usage ###
All the data we used can be found in the following link: https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page

We stored our dataset outside the GitHub repository to avoid pushing large objects frequently.
Feel free to download the data.csv file and change the directory to access it appropriately.


### Visualizations ###
All the vizualisations use in the presentation can be found in the Final_Viz_team23.ipynb file, and the images we generated are stored alongside in the Presentation_Visualization folder. The visualization done after time of presentation are added in the heat_map folder under VisualizationNotebooks folder.
